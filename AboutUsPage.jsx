            <p> The vision of Kep Gardens was born in December, 2006 after a holiday in Cambodia and has grown from there. We were impressed by the overwhelming friendliness and <br />
                determination of the people despite their long and violent history that resulted in their poor socioeconomic conditions, particularly in the rural communities. We had been <br />
                seeking avenues to contribute in a valuable and meaningful way to society in the later years of our life that could be achievable with limited monetary resources. What <br /> 
                started out as a holiday has turned into a determination to help make a brighter future for the children and youth in a small, Cambodian, rural community.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Andrew has a mechanical engineering and building background gaining a Degree in Mechanical Engineering and building various houses in Adelaide. Janine gained a <br /> 
                Business College Diploma and completed her teaching certificate in Papua New Guinea. Both taught their skills for 5 years in Papua New Guinea. Janine was involved in <br />
                Special Education teaching and finance for over 15 years in various Adelaide schools while Andrew concentrated on manufacturing engineering and construction projects.
            </p>

            <p className="text-1xl lg:h-[120px]">
                The project has been self-funded but our objective is to ensure that the project is sustainable in the long term. We receive some funds through the generosity of <br />
                individuals and the maintenance work of our trade skills section.
